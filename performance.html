    <ul>
        <li>It is recommended that the development (training, testing), validation and evaluation of the objective
            algorithms' databases evenly and equally cover both simulated and live network conditions</li>
        <li>It is strongly recommended to select databases for evaluation that reflect the use cases of the objective
            prediction method.</li>
        <li>For avoiding biases between simulations and real field data, the evaluation set should
            contain databases where simulated and real field data are mixed in the same experiment.</li>
        <li>The quality of the test samples used in each subjective experiment should allow the voters to use the
            entire MOS scale.</li>
        <li>It is recommended that prior to analysis, an inspection of the subjective and objective test data be
            performed to uncover any types of outliers. Example: time clipping effect.</li>
        <li>The group of people remains the same during the experiment, and the stimuli, that is, the 'context',
            covers the same range of test conditions for everyone in the group. The average of the individual
            scores per-sample or per-test condition forms the MOS. The MOS is an average with a certain
            statistical uncertainty, since not all people will mark the sample with exactly the same score.</li>
