    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>

    <h4>1. Source files</h4>
    <p>Reference audio can be sourced from anywhere. Speech audio should be 6-12 seconds in length.</p>

    <h4>2. Ratings</h4>
    
    <p>Listening tests are conducted to collect the following ratings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Overall quality</em> MOS</li>
        <li><em>Coloration</em> COL (i.e. resulting from frequency response distortions, e.g. bandwidth restrictions and
            coloration introduced by transducers)</li>
        <li><em>Noisiness</em> NOI (e.g. resulting from additive and multiplicative noise)</li>
        <li><em>Discontinuity</em> DIS (e.g. resulting from time localized and time-varying degradations)</li>
        <li><em>Loudness</em> LOUD (e.g. impact of overall play back level)</li>
    </ul>
